Step 2: Use Eager Loading (with()) to Prevent N+1 Queries

For example, to get novels with all volumes and their chapters:

$novels = Novel::with('author', 'volumes.chapters', 'categories')->paginate(10);

This will load:

   The novel’s author

   All volumes belonging to each novel

   All chapters within each volume

   The categories the novel belongs to

That’s 1 query + a few joins instead of 100s of queries.

✅ Step 3: Use Join When You Need Filtering/Sorting on Related Table Fields

If you need to filter or sort based on related table columns (e.g. get all novels where author's name is ‘John’), you can join like this:

$novels = Novel::select('novels.*') ->join('users', 'users.id', '=', 'novels.translator_id') ->where('users.name', 'John') ->with('author', 'volumes.chapters', 'categories') ->get();

✅ Bonus Tip: Use Indexes

Make sure your foreign keys (like novel_id, volume_id, translator_id) are indexed in your migrations to speed up joins and lookups.

Example:

$table->unsignedBigInteger('translator_id')->index();

✅ Conclusion

With proper relationship definitions + eager loading + join queries where needed, you’ll get both readable Eloquent and fast query performance.

If you want, I can also show you how to cache common queries like homepage novel listings or hot categories with Laravel cache for super fast loading.
